So, I brought my guitar today. It is **Enya EA-X1 Pro**.\
The guitar is 41'' variant. There is solid spruce top which is dried for 10 years. Side is made up of Rosewood, Neck from Mahogany, Fingerboard from Black Richlite and bridge from Black Richlite. So, no more waiting for guitar to sound good as time progress.

Also, it is my first experience with trans-acoustic guitar. The self amp inside the guitar works really well and it sounds amazing when played. Here, the trans-acoustic means I don't have to plug in the amp and do the sound modification like chores/reverb. They are built inside the guitar itself.\

The overall cost of the guitar was 36000 NPR. It comes with basic accessories and really nice bag from Enya.
